## Introduction:
The HR Attrition Analysis project aims to uncover patterns and insights behind employee departures by utilizing data analysis techniques. By understanding the reasons for attrition, identifying risk factors, and making data-driven decisions, this project seeks to improve employee retention rates within an organization.

## Problem Statement:
The primary objective of this project is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of HR attrition data. The challenge involves analyzing a real-world dataset sourced from Kaggle to gain insights into user behavior, preferences, and trends related to attrition. Specific areas of analysis include attrition by age, education, job role, case severity, and sales, with the goal of providing valuable information for content creators, marketers, and platform optimization.

## Overview:

Data Extraction: The project begins with the extraction of a comprehensive HR Attrition dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains information on user interactions, content preferences, and viewing patterns.
Data Preprocessing: To ensure data accuracy and consistency, extensive data cleaning is performed. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and organizing the data for analysis.
Power BI Dashboard: Power BI is utilized to create visually engaging and informative representations of the data. Various types of visualizations, such as bar plots, area charts, and column charts, are generated to illustrate user engagement, content popularity, and viewing habits.

## Project Details:

Data Extraction : A thorough extraction process retrieves the HR Attrition dataset from Kaggle, ensuring access to relevant user behavior data.
Data Preprocessing: The data undergoes cleaning and transformation to enhance its quality and usability for analysis.
Power BI Dashboard: Power BI is employed to design interactive and insightful visualizations that provide a clear understanding of user engagement and content preferences.
